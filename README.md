## How It Works

### Ghost Mode Technology

The application uses different techniques depending on your operating system:

- **Windows**: 
  - `SetWindowDisplayAffinity` with `WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE` flag
  - `DwmSetWindowAttribute` with `DWMWA_CLOAK` for advanced hiding
  - Additional window style modifications to prevent detection

- **Linux**: 
  - Combines X11/Wayland window properties
  - Uses selective transparency and window type modifications
  - Applies CSS techniques to avoid compositor capture

- **WSL**: 
  - Specialized window layering and visibility settings
  - Window property modifications to avoid detection
  - CSS and rendering adjustments to evade capture systems

- **macOS**: 
  - Window layering and opacity adjustments
  - Content protection and workspace visibility modifications
  - Specialized window button visibility settings

These techniques make the window completely invisible to screen recording software while still being visible to you.

### Screenshot Processing

1. The app captures screenshots of your screen
2. Images are processed using OpenAI's Vision API
3. The AI analyzes the LeetCode problem and generates a comprehensive solution
4. The solution is displayed with syntax highlighting, explanations, and complexity analysis

## WSL Setup

To run the application in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), you'll need an X server on Windows:

### 1. Install an X Server on Windows

We recommend using [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) or [Xming](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/).

#### Using VcXsrv:
1. Download and install VcXsrv from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/)
2. Start XLaunch
3. In the settings:
   - Select "Multiple windows" and "Display number" as 0
   - Select "Start no client"
   - In "Extra settings", check "Disable access control"
   - **Important**: When finishing, ensure Windows Firewall allows both public and private connections

### 2. Configure WSL

1. Use our automated launcher script:

```bash
npm run wsl
```

This script will:
- Automatically configure the DISPLAY variable
- Detect whether you're using WSL1 or WSL2
- Try multiple DISPLAY options until it finds a working one
- Provide troubleshooting tips if the X server is not found

2. Alternatively, you can manually configure:

```bash
# For WSL2
export DISPLAY=$(grep -m 1 nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | awk '{print $2}'):0.0

# For WSL1
export DISPLAY=:0
```

### WSL Troubleshooting

#### Window doesn't appear:
- **VcXsrv not running**: Start VcXsrv using XLaunch
- **Firewall settings**: Make sure VcXsrv has permission in the firewall for BOTH public AND private connections
- **Access control**: Make sure to check "Disable access control" in VcXsrv settings
- **Incorrect DISPLAY**: Try manually adjusting DISPLAY:
  ```bash
  # Try these options:
  export DISPLAY=:0
  export DISPLAY=:0.0
  export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0
  export DISPLAY=$(grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | awk '{print $2}'):0.0
  ```

#### Ghost Mode limitations in WSL:
- In WSL, there are technical limitations for ghost mode due to architectural differences
- Basic mode still works, but some advanced techniques aren't available in WSL

#### Testing X11 configuration:
- Run this command to check if X11 is working:
  ```bash
  xeyes
  ```
  If a window with eyes appears, your X11 is properly configured

## Build Distribution

To create distribution packages for different platforms, we use Electron Builder. This will create installers, executables, and portable packages that you can distribute.

### Creating Application Icons

Before building the distribution packages, you should create proper application icons:

- **Windows**: `assets/images/icon.png` (256x256 or larger)
- **macOS**: `assets/images/icon.icns`
- **Linux**: `assets/images/icon.png` (256x256 or larger)

### Building Packages

```bash
# For all platforms
npm run dist:all

# For specific platforms
npm run dist:win    # Windows
npm run dist:mac    # macOS
npm run dist:linux  # Linux
```

The distribution packages will be created in the `dist/` directory.

## Releases

We use GitHub Actions to automate the build and release process. For detailed information about the release process, see [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).

### Creating a New Release

To create a new release:

```bash
# For patch version (bug fixes) - 1.4.0 -> 1.4.1
npm run release:patch

# For minor version (new features) - 1.4.0 -> 1.5.0
npm run release:minor

# For major version (breaking changes) - 1.4.0 -> 2.0.0
npm run release:major
```

These commands will automatically:
- Update the version in package.json
- Create a git commit and tag
- Push to GitHub
- Trigger GitHub Actions to build and publish the release
