## How It Works

### Ghost Mode Technology

The application uses different techniques depending on your operating system:

- **Windows**: 
  - `SetWindowDisplayAffinity` with `WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE` flag
  - `DwmSetWindowAttribute` with `DWMWA_CLOAK` for advanced hiding
  - Additional window style modifications to prevent detection

- **Linux**: 
  - Combines X11/Wayland window properties
  - Uses selective transparency and window type modifications
  - Applies CSS techniques to avoid compositor capture

- **WSL**: 
  - Specialized window layering and visibility settings
  - Window property modifications to avoid detection
  - CSS and rendering adjustments to evade capture systems

- **macOS**: 
  - Window layering and opacity adjustments
  - Content protection and workspace visibility modifications
  - Specialized window button visibility settings

These techniques make the window completely invisible to screen recording software while still being visible to you.

### Screenshot Processing

1. The app captures screenshots of your screen
2. Images are processed using OpenAI's Vision API
3. The AI analyzes the LeetCode problem and generates a comprehensive solution
4. The solution is displayed with syntax highlighting, explanations, and complexity analysis

## WSL Setup

To run the application in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), you'll need an X server on Windows:

### 1. Install an X Server on Windows

We recommend using [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) or [Xming](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/).

#### Using VcXsrv:
1. Download and install VcXsrv from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/)
2. Start XLaunch
3. In the settings:
   - Select "Multiple windows" and "Display number" as 0
   - Select "Start no client"
   - In "Extra settings", check "Disable access control"
   - **Important**: When finishing, ensure Windows Firewall allows both public and private connections

### 2. Configure WSL

1. Use our automated launcher script:

```bash
npm run wsl
```

This script will:
- Automatically configure the DISPLAY variable
- Detect whether you're using WSL1 or WSL2
- Try multiple DISPLAY options until it finds a working one
- Provide troubleshooting tips if the X server is not found

2. Alternatively, you can manually configure:

```bash
# For WSL2
export DISPLAY=$(grep -m 1 nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | awk '{print $2}'):0.0

# For WSL1
export DISPLAY=:0
```

### WSL Troubleshooting

#### Window doesn't appear:
- **VcXsrv not running**: Start VcXsrv using XLaunch
- **Firewall settings**: Make sure VcXsrv has permission in the firewall for BOTH public AND private connections
- **Access control**: Make sure to check "Disable access control" in VcXsrv settings
- **Incorrect DISPLAY**: Try manually adjusting DISPLAY:
  ```bash
  # Try these options:
  export DISPLAY=:0
  export DISPLAY=:0.0
  export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0
  export DISPLAY=$(grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | awk '{print $2}'):0.0
  ```

#### Ghost Mode limitations in WSL:
- In WSL, there are technical limitations for ghost mode due to architectural differences
- Basic mode still works, but some advanced techniques aren't available in WSL

#### Testing X11 configuration:
- Run this command to check if X11 is working:
  ```bash
  xeyes
  ```
  If a window with eyes appears, your X11 is properly configured

## Build Distribution

To create distribution packages for different platforms, we use Electron Builder. This will create installers, executables, and portable packages that you can distribute.

### Creating Application Icons

Before building the distribution packages, you should create proper application icons:

1. **Required Icon Formats**:
   - Windows: `.ico` file (256x256 pixels recommended)
   - macOS: `.icns` file
   - Linux: `.png` files in multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256)

2. **Creating Icons**:
   - You can use tools like [Icon Maker](https://iconmaker.app/) or [Electron Icon Generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-icon-builder)
   - For command line, install the icon generator:
     ```bash
     npm install -g electron-icon-builder
     ```
   - Then generate icons:
     ```bash
     electron-icon-builder --input=./source-icon.png --output=./assets
     ```

3. **Icon Placement**:
   - Place Windows icons in `assets/images/icon.ico`
   - Place macOS icons in `assets/images/icon.icns`
   - Place Linux icons in `assets/images/` with proper sizes

### Pre-requisites

Make sure you have all dependencies installed:

```bash
npm install
```

### Building Distribution Packages

#### For All Platforms
```bash
npm run dist
```

#### For Specific Platforms

**Windows:**
```bash
npm run dist:win
```
This will create:
- `dist/leetcode-ghost-window-Setup-{version}.exe` - Windows installer
- `dist/leetcode-ghost-window-{version}-win.zip` - Portable Windows application

**macOS:**
```bash
npm run dist:mac
```
This will create:
- `dist/LeetCode Ghost Window-{version}.dmg` - macOS disk image
- `dist/LeetCode Ghost Window-{version}-mac.zip` - Compressed macOS application

**Linux:**
```bash
npm run dist:linux
```
This will create:
- `dist/leetcode-ghost-window-{version}.AppImage` - Cross-distro AppImage
- `dist/leetcode-ghost-window_{version}_amd64.deb` - Debian/Ubuntu package
- `dist/leetcode-ghost-window-{version}.x86_64.rpm` - Red Hat/Fedora package

### Publishing to GitHub Releases

To automatically publish your builds to GitHub Releases:

1. Create a GitHub personal access token with `repo` scope
2. Set the token as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GH_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```
3. Run the release command:
   ```bash
   npm run dist -- -p always
   ```

### Code Signing

For production builds, you should sign your application:

#### Windows Code Signing
```bash
npm run dist:win -- --win --x64 --ia32 --c.win.certificateFile=/path/to/cert.pfx --c.win.certificatePassword=password
```

#### macOS Code Signing
```bash
npm run dist:mac -- --mac --c.mac.identity='Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)'
```
